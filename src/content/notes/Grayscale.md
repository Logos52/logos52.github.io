There have been a lot of articles that describe how cars are moving more toward a monochromatic palette, ie. grays, whites, and blacks. 

I feel like I'm moving in that direction, except it's in fashion, not just cars. Fast fashion, I feel like all of us can agree, is a problem that affects humanity as a whole. One way to prevent that is to focus on a more neutral palette. The idea is

There's a reason why style is so important to me. It's a presentation of your values before you've had a chance to communicate. I both care a lot and don't care, which is I suppose an ideal situation for anyone looking to turn something into a routine. 

Style is something highly contingent, meaning it's unique to the presenter. It serves as a sort of "brain priming", or trigger the brain to prepare for a set of input the brain may already be familiar with. Fundamentally speaking, styles are a collection of methods, mindsets, and behaviors.

Characters from Japanese anime usually have one exaggerated feature to distinguish them from others. Like a logo they wear on their body.
Eg. Big ears or large glasses. Harry Potter scar+spectacles.

The reason why Uniqlo is so popular is that the clothes are designed to recede into the background. 迷惑 in fashion. Certain items need to recede for others to rise to the surface.

Other notes:
From the book "The Elements of Style" (A book about writing)
>Write in a way that draws the reader's attention the sense and substance of the writing, rather than to the mood and temper of the author. If the writing is good, the mood & temper of the author will be revealed and not at the expense of the work. To achieve style, begin by affecting none -- that is, place yourself in the background.

>A careful and honest writer does not need to worry about style. As you become proficient in the use of language, your style will emerge, because you yourself will emerge, and when this happens you will find it increasingly easy to break through the barriers that separate you from other minds, other hearts -- which is, of course, the purpose of writing, as well as its principal reward.

>Fortunately, the act of composition, or creation, disciplines the mind; writing is one way to go about thinking, and the practice and habit of writing not only drain the mind but supply it, too.
